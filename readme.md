# Computer Science II
## Lab 5.0 - Inheritance

An introduction to using inheritance in the Java programming language.

This is a lab used in Computer Science II (CSCE 156, CSCE 156H) in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.unl.edu) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

## Overview

### Resources

Prior to lab you should read/review the following resources.

-  Read the following tutorial on inheritance in Java  
   <http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html>

-  Read about abstract methods and abstract classes in Java  
   <http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html>

-  Read about interfaces in Java  
   <http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html>
   
### Lab Objectives & Topics

Following the lab, you should:

-   Understand Inheritance and design classes and subclasses in Java

-   Understand and use interfaces and abstract classes in Java

-   Understand and use the `implements` and `extends` keywords

### Peer Programming Pair-Up

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs will be
structured in a *pair programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you may be randomly paired up with another student by
a lab instructor.  One of you will be designated the *driver* 
and the other the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions 
and telling the driver what is to be done.  The driver will be 
in charge of the keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and 
navigator are responsible for suggesting fixes and solutions 
*together*.  Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge."  
Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help and 
interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should try to alternate: if you were a driver 
last week, be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you 
were both drivers last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab 
instructor to resolve issues only when you cannot come to a 
consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely 
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with 
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

## 1. Getting Started

instructions on how to clone a project from GitHub.

## 2. Inheritance

Object Oriented Programming allows you to define a hierarchy of objects
using *inheritance*. Inheritance promotes code reuse and semantic
relations between objects. Subclasses provide specialization of behavior
by allowing you to override object methods while preserving common
functionality (generalization) defined in the super-class.

As a class-based object-oriented programming language, Java facilitates
inheritance through subclassing by using the keyword extends. If class
*B* `extends` class *A*, *B* is said to be a subclass of *A* (*A* is a
superclass of *B*). Instances of class $B$ are also instances of class
*A*, defining an "is-a" relation between them. Java also provides two
related mechanisms related to subclassing.

-   *Abstract Classes* – Java allows you to specify that a class is
    abstract using the keyword `abstract`. In an abstract class, you can define
    not only normal methods (which you provide a "default"
    implementation for) but you can also define abstract methods:
    methods that you do not need to provide an implementation for.
    Instead, it is the responsibility of non-abstract subclass(es) to
    provide an implementation. In addition, if a class is abstract, you
    are prevented from instantiating any instances of it.

-   *Interfaces* – Java allows you to define interfaces, which are
    essentially pure abstract classes. Interfaces specify the methods
    that a class must provide in order to implement the interface. Java
    allows you to define an interface that specifies the public
    interface (methods) of a class. Classes can then be defined to
    implement an interface using the `implements` keyword. One advantage of
    interfaces is that it does not lock your classes into a rigid
    hierarchy; however objects that implement an interface can still be
    considered to have the is-a relationship. In addition, interfaces
    can be used to simulate multiple-inheritance in Java as classes can
    implement more than one interface.

## 3. Activities 

You will explore these concepts by completing a Java program that
simulates a basic weekly payroll reporting system for the Cinco
Corporation. Every employee has an employee ID, a name (first and last),
and a title. Further, there are two types of employees:

-   Salaried employees – Salaried employees have a base annual salary,
    which is subject to a 20% income tax rate (state, federal and FICA
    combined). In addition, each salaried employee receives a \$100
    post-tax benefits allowance.

-   Hourly employees – Hourly employees have a per-hour pay rate along
    with a weekly total of the number of hours they worked. Hourly
    employees do not receive any benefit allowance. Further, there are
    two types of hourly employees.

    -   Staff employees are directly employed by Cinco and are subject
        to a 15% income tax rate.

    -   Temporary employees are not directly employed by Cinco, but
        instead are contracted through a third-party temp agency who is
        responsible for collecting taxes (thus no taxes are taken from
        their gross pay).

Employee data is stored in a flat data file and the basic parsing has
been provided. However, you will need to design and implement Java
classes to support and model this payroll system. By the end of this lab
your class designs should resemble something like the following UML 
Diagram.  A UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagram is a graphical
representation of classes and their relationships.

### 3.1 Class Design & Inheritance 

You have been provided a partially completed program that parses a data
file (in ) and creates instances of an . However, the class is empty.
You will need to implement this class and any relevant subclass(es) to
complete the program.

-   Identify the different classes necessary to model each of the
    different types of employees in the problem statement.

-   Identify the relationship between these classes.

-   Identify the state (variables) that are common to these classes and
    the state that distinguishes them. Where do each of these pieces of
    data belong?

-   Identify the behavior (methods) that are common to each of these
    classes–what are methods that should be in the superclass? How
    should subclasses provide specialized behavior?

-   Some state/behavior may be common to several classes–is there an
    opportunity to define an intermediate class?

-   If you need more guidance, consult the UML diagram below on one
    possible design.

-   To check your work, a text file containing the expected output has
    been provided in the project (see `output/expectedOutput.txt`)

***Eclipse Tip***: Many of the common programming tasks when dealing with
objects can be automated by your IDE. For example: once you have
designed the state (variables) of your class, you can automatically
generate the boilerplate getters, setters, and constructors: when
focused on your class, click "Source" then "Generate Getters
and Setters" or "Generate Constructors using Fields."

***Java Note***: In a subclass, you *must* invoke a constructor in the
superclass and it must be done first. This rule is so that classes
conform to the is-a relationship. Invoking a super class’s constructor
is achieved by using the `super` keyword. If there are multiple constructors,
you may invoke any one of them. Note that if a constructor does not
explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the Java compiler
automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the
superclass. If the superclass does not have a no-argument constructor,
you will get a compile-time error. The Java `Object` class has a no-arg
constructor, so if your class does not explicitly extend a class, it
implicitly `extends Object` and the no-arg constructor is invoked.

### 3.2 Abstractions

Now that you have a well designed, functional implementation we will
improve on the design by identifying potential abstractions that can be
made. Start by making the `Employee` class abstract. If you had a
good design, then nothing should break; the model did not have any
generic employee–all employees were of a specific type. If something did
break in your code, rethink your design and make the appropriate
changes.

Identify one or more methods in the `Employee` class that could be made
abstract. That is, are there any methods in the superclass where it
would not be appropriate to have a "default" definition? Make these
methods abstract and again make any appropriate changes to your design
as necessary.

### 3.3 Adding an Interface

Cinco Corporation also has suppliers that they purchase supplies and
parts from to build their products. Suppliers have a company name and an
amount due, and so need to be paid, but they are not employees. However,
the payroll department would like to have a common interface across all
objects in their system that are, in some way, payable.

1.  Create an interface (In Eclipse: right click the package
    then "new" then "Interface") called `Payable`. Identify a
    single method in this interface that returns the (net) amount
    payable

2.  Make the `Employee` class implement this new interface and make the appropriate
    changes if necessary

3.  Create a new class to represent suppliers and also make it `Payable`


### 4. Testing, Submitting & Grading

* Test your programs using the provided JUnit test suite(s).  Fix any
errors and completely debug your programs.
* Submit *all* of your source files through webhandin.
* Run the grader and verify the output to complete your lab.

### Advanced Activity (Optional) 

1.  The `PayrollReport` class uses an `ArrayList` to hold instances of 
    `Employee` objects. When it generates
    the report, it does so in the order that the instances were parsed
    from the data file. Change this so that the payroll report prints in
    order of the total net pay in decreasing order.

2.  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a common tool in Software
    Engineering that provides a visualization of the relationships
    between software components (subsystems, components, classes,
    workflows, use cases, etc.). Sometimes design of systems is done in
    UML and then tools can automatically generate Java (or other
    language) code conforming to the design. Conversely, UML diagrams
    can be automatically generated
    from an existing code base using various tools. In this exercise you
    will familiarize yourself with UML and use such a tool to generate a
    UML diagram for your design.
